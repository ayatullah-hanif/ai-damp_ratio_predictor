ðŸ§± Concrete Damping Ratio Prediction

This project predicts the damping ratio of concrete based on mix design parameters such as cement, sand, aggregate, rubber content, and water-to-cement ratio.
It uses a machine learning model (Random Forest Regressor) trained on experimental dataset to provide fast and accurate predictions.

ðŸš€ Features

Predict damping ratio using six input parameters:

Cement content (kg/mÂ³)

Fine aggregate (sand) content (kg/mÂ³)

Coarse aggregate content (kg/mÂ³)

Rubber content (kg/mÂ³)

Water-to-cement ratio

Water (%)

Interactive Streamlit web app for user-friendly predictions.

Displays model performance metrics (RMSE, MAE, RÂ², MAPE).

Visualizations for better model interpretation (Predicted vs Actual, Residuals).

ðŸ“Š Model Performance

On test data, the model achieved:

RMSE: 0.0048

MAE: 0.0036

RÂ²: 0.9923

MAPE: 4.84%

âœ… This means the model explains 99.2% of the variability in damping ratio and has high predictive accuracy.

ðŸ”® Future Improvements

-Add more visualization features inside the app.

-Experiment with other ML models (XGBoost, Neural Networks).

-Deploy online (Streamlit Cloud / Heroku / AWS).
